# tadhack-incident-tropo-pcs-demo

This node code was built for the TADHack Global 2016 event. This contribution was part of the Team #FF0000 hack for "race car telemetry and incident workflow automation".

@TODO - add link to post and video

To access the code it:

1. Clone or download Zip file
2. Install the dependent modules for expressjs, tropo-web, body-parser

Note: Since this code integrates with Tropo, an active Tropo application is required as well as access to Internet.

The hack includes additional components that are not available here, please refer to Oracle Cloud Services documentation for additional information to replicate this hack.
